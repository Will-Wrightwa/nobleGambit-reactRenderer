This is a renderer for nobleGambit chess.
This renderer and others will plug in to the buisiness logic of nobleGambit in order to allow for multiple visual interfaces for the game. The architechture of the plugin is still in flux and has not been decided upon yet. Along with this renderer I plan on making a cliRenderer and a threejsRender.
* Dependencies not listed in npm are: nobleGambit.

Let me know if you have any questions about this project.
